Indiana University Extra Credit Movies

In the Fall of 2016 Katherine Metcalf and Prof. David Leake at Indiana University arranged to offer extra credit to students in Informatics and Computer Science classes in exchange for creating and narrating new movies using the "Heider-Simmel Interactive Theater" online application.

Provided here are 130 files that were created by converting the original svg transforms into x,y, and rotation for each character. The first value in each line is the time from start, in milliseconds. The last value is the rotation of the door.

Best citation is probably this one:
